## Installation
Before you start you'll need: Node.js version 16 (https://nodejs.org/en/download/) MySQL (https://dev.mysql.com/downloads/mysql/)

Enter the .env file. It should show the following information plus your personal password (remember to add this to the .gitignore) DB_NAME='techblog_db' DB_USER='root' DB_PASSWORD =" ". 

 Run an npm install to load json and schema. Next mysql -u root -p submit your password (it will be hidden). Next run source db/schema.sql then you can quit sql. Run npm start you will then see listening in your terminal. 

  From here you should be able to add a branch and add code.
